/// @brief Implementations of utility functions for storing binary information safely in
/// ASCII files.  This uses the trick of using four bytes of ASCII information to store
/// three bytes of binary information, using only the 64 bitstrings corresponding to the
/// characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /.  Note that this avoids whitespace and EOF characters.
