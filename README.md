## Licence

Masala is released under an AGPL version 3 licence.  This licence permits anyone to use the software for any purpose (not-for-profit or commercial), as well as to modify the software and incorporate it into derivative works.  The one stipulation is that if any modified version or derivative work is distributed, or users are given access to it over a network, then the source code must be made available under an AGPL licence (version 3 or later).  This ensures that the software remains free and open-source.  For full details, see the LICENCE file.
